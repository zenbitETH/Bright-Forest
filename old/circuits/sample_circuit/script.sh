# --r1cs:
## The --r1cs contains the Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS) in binary format. 
## With circom, we design our own circuits with our own constraints, and the compiler 
## outputs the R1CS representation that will be needed for your zero-knowledge proof.

# --wasm:
## Generates a directory [name]_js where the .wasm file lives. 
## These files are used to generate the witness, i.e., the set of signals that satisfy the circuit.

# --sym:
## Generates the file [name].sym. 
## These symbols file are used to debugging/printing the constraint system in an annotated mode.

# --c:
## Generates the directory [name]_cpp. 
## Contains the equivalent of the wasm directory used to generate the witness of the circuit.

## Computing the witness with WebAssembly
### For this we need to generate a witness: a set of signals that satisfy the circuit. 
### We'll need an inputs JSON file that contains all the circuit's inputs.

# Logic/programmatic logic files: generate_witness.js, merkle.wasm 
# Input file: input.json
# Output file: witness.wtns
## The two programs will generate the same ẁitness.wtns file. 
## This file is encoded in a binary format compatible with snarkjs, 
## which is the tool that we use to create the actual proofs.

## We will use Groth16 here. It is a zk-SNARK protocol. 
## To use it, one needs to generate a trusted setup.
## As per the paper by cryptographic researchers, we need a common source of entropy to generate the proof.
## The trusted setup generation is equivalent to some ceremony where people agree to some source of randomness.
## It is considered a potential point of failure as any actor 
## should not know the seed to the randomness used by all participants 
## (unlikely in the real world, but important to know). 

# Phase 1 of the trusted setup generation is called the "Powers of Tau".
# It is independent of the circuit itself. 
# Note that one should choose a power of tau high enough to run phase 2,
# otherwise will get an error of the from "X > 2^n".
